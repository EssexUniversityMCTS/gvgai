"""
This controller is based on a shallow reinforcement learning method, true online Sarsa(lambda) with linear function
approximation, dutch traces and softmax/epsilon-greedy action selection policy [1]. In addition, "Double" and "Expected"
variants of Sarsa algorithm are employed [2].

States are represented with hand-designed features which are comprised of normalized relative proximity values between
the closest (with respect to Manhattan distance) observations of item type pairs.
